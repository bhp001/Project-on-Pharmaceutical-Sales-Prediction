Nexthike Project 06: Pharmaceutical Sales Prediction Across Multiple Stores

Introduction

Rossmann Pharmaceuticals has tasked us with a sales forecasting project. The finance team requires a system that can predict sales for all their stores across various cities, six weeks in advance. Currently, store managers use their experience and intuition for sales predictions. However, the data team has identified critical factors that influence sales, such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and location. 

The objective is to build a comprehensive end-to-end solution that provides accurate sales forecasts to the finance team, helping them make data-driven decisions.

Objectives

The main goal of this project is to create a robust predictive model capable of forecasting pharmaceutical sales for multiple store locations. This model will help store managers make informed decisions regarding inventory management and staffing, ultimately improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer satisfaction.

 Project Workflow

1. Data Exploration: The project began with loading and examining the dataset to understand its structure, data types, value ranges, and overall data distribution.
   
2. Data Preprocessing: This step involved managing missing values, identifying and handling outliers, and resolving any inconsistencies in the dataset.

3. Task 1: Analysis of Customer Purchasing Behavior: Understanding how customers interact with stores and what factors influence their purchasing decisions.

4. Task 2: Prediction of Store Sales: Developing and training predictive models to forecast sales across different stores.

5.Task 3: Serving Predictions via Web Interface: Deploying the model and creating a web interface to serve predictions, making it accessible to analysts in the finance team.

Note: The model file size is approximately 2.79 GB and cannot be uploaded here.
